# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply as expected.  The issue involves a background gradient, text alignment, and padding. The HTML structure is seemingly correct, yet the styling does not render as intended.  The `bug.html` file shows the problem, and `bugSolution.html` provides a solution.
