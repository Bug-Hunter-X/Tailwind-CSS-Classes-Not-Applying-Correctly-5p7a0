The issue was caused by missing or incorrect configuration of the Tailwind CSS setup. It's solved by ensuring the correct Tailwind directives are present in the `tailwind.config.js` file and that the `@tailwind` directives are correctly added to the CSS file (usually `index.css` or `global.css`). In the case of the gradient, it needed to be added to the `theme` in `tailwind.config.js` to ensure it was supported. The solution is implemented in `bugSolution.html` which will style correctly.
